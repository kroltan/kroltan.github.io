            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Leonardo, a web developer who also makes games in his spare time.
                Maybe someday I'll make them full-time!
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently I'm located in Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina, Brazil, which is a naturally beautiful island
                city.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need to talk to me, I'm available at a variety of services.
                Don't expect an immediate response in instant messagers!
            </p>

                If you're wondering why this website is so barren and textual, well, to be honest, me too! At least it
                loads blazingly fast on mobile and is completely responsive. Without a single <code>@media</code> query!

                    Community-created alternate server for <span title="Atmosphir">a game</span> whose official services
                    was shutdown.
                    Lots of reverse-engineering work went into it, resulting in a (honestly very messy) PHP codebase.
                    In my defense, I was 15!
                </p>
                <p>We also built a supporting launcher/updater, as well as a simple homepage.</p>
                <p>
                    I acted as a developer and project manager for the server project, as well as helping conceptualize
                    and develop other tools related to the game. The team size varied over time, but was at its most
                    composed of 4 people.

                    An entry to the famous <a href="https://ldjam.com">Ludum Dare</a> game jam, where you must make a
                    game from scratch, alone or as a team, within 48 or 72 hours. On top of that, a theme is provided
                    to guide the ideas and facilitate rating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game is about some guy whose phone's battery is low, and he must break into houses and venues
                    to steal electricity from the outlets. But the police is after him for being a <em>Joule Thief</em>!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I acted as a developer, game designer and project manager, with the team also having one graphical
                    and one sound artists, who also helped with game design.
